# Online psychological experiments

These're part of materials of the online experiments I built with [Open Science Tools](https://opensciencetools.org/).

Which include: 

- PsychoPy
  - One of the most popular open-source packages for running experiments in psychology, neuroscience and related behavioral sciences. Here's their [github](https://github.com/psychopy) and [offical website](https://www.psychopy.org/).
- PsychoJS
  - The JavaScript port of the PsychoPy library. Its purpose is to make PsychoPy experiments available online, from a web page. Here's their [github](https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs).
- Pavlovia
  - A place for the wide community of researchers in the behavioural sciences to run, share, and explore experiments online. Here's their [offical website](https://pavlovia.org/docs/home/about).

Thanks for all contributors, helping researchers could easily lunch experiments on online platforms without lots of cost. Which is efficient, and good for science community!
